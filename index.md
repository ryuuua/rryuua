      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        I am a master's student at the Nara Institute of Science and Technology, advised by Kubo Takatomi.
        I was affiliated faculty of literature at Keio University during my undergraduate studies.
        Through my undergraduate experience, hard days since it hardly did not fit my interests,
        I came to realize that my interests lie in the language and the neural mechanisms behind it.
        I am just starting out my research career, and excited to explore new ideas and collaborate with others.
